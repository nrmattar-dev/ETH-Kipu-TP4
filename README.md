# SimpleSwap
Practical Work No. 4 (ETH Kipu) by Nahuel Ruiz Mattar

SimpleSwap is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to exchange two ERC-20 tokens, Thurisaz and Uruz, on a blockchain network. The application provides a simple user interface to connect wallets, perform swaps, and check prices, in addition to maintaining a transaction history.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection**: Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the DApp.
- **Token Swaps**:
  - Swap Thurisaz for Uruz.
  - Swap Uruz for Thurisaz.
  - Define a minimum amount to receive to protect against price volatility.
- **Price Inquiry**: Get the current price of 1 Thurisaz in Uruz and vice versa.
- **Swap History**: View a detailed record of your exchange transactions, including balances before and after the swap.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: A clean and easy-to-use design for a smooth user experience.
